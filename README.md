# firstproject (heading 1)

#### just learning how to use github

this is my first attempt in learning how to document a data analysis on Github. I am documenting this for my record, so that when I go back, I'd know how much I improved!
Below are the steps in documenting a data analysis project:

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
provide a brief overview of what your project is about.

### TABLE OF CONTENTS
provide a table of contents

### DATA SOURCE
explain your data source. provide a link if you got it from somewhere else. Also, provide a brief description, or put the data dictionary

### TOOLS
- for example, excel for data cleaning [Download this](https://microsoft.com) -- To add a link, use this code
- tableau for data visualization

### DATA CLEANING/PREPARATION
how did you clean your data? what were the tasks?
- better put it in bullet points
1. or use numbers
2. number 2

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
answer your questions. for example In smoking data analysis, you can do some basic exploratory data analysis like, among smokers, how many have lung disease...

### DATA ANALYSIS
to write your codes here, include back ticks ` below is an example
```SQL
SELECT * FROM patient;
```

### RESULTS/FINDINGS
mention whatever you found on your analysis. do a summary of the findings

### RECOMMENDATIONS
you are a data analyst and you just analyzed your data, found patterns, correlations, differences.... now what? provide a recommendation TO ADD VALUE to your company

### LIMITATIONS
what were the limitations of your data analysis?
- data limitations, talk about sample size, sampling method, and the quality of the data
- methodological limitations...
- external validity
- measurement limitations
- theoretical and conceptual limitations
- ethical concerns
- practical concerns
- implication for future research
